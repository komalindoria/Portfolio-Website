      <h2>I’m Komal Indoria, a sophomore who's been upskilling herself with Web Desiging and Development in sunny New Delhi, India.</h2>
      <h3>I’ve spent the past couple of years working across different areas of DSA and digital design; front-end development, email design, marketing site pages, app UI/UX, to my current role developing and designing web pages.
        These days, my time is spent researching, designing, prototyping, and coding. I also help my peer step into the world of designing.
        Out of the office you’ll find me ravenously devouring nachos, binging Netflix, and petting all the good dogs.</h3>
